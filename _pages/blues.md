The BLUES (Beyond Linear Use of Equation Superposition) function method is a powerful approach for analytically solving (nonlinear) differential equations. It employs an iterative procedure to find approximations to the solution and is effective for nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations. The analytical approximations obtained usually converge exponentially to the exact solutions. Even the zeroth-order approximation provides useful results, while the first-order approximation remains accurate and relatively easy to compute. The method also offers flexibility in handling different types of nonlinearities.

My PhD research on the BLUES method involved extending the formalism beyond ordinary differential equations to tackle coupled systems and partial differential equations. One particular example is in epidemiology; the method accurately approximates the time evolution of population fractions in a SIRS model with vaccination, outperforming alternative methods in terms of rapid and global convergence. It accurately predicts the infection peak time and generates analytic expressions closely matching numerical solutions.
