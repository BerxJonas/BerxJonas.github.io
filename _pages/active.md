The study of collective behavior and dynamics of systems composed of self-propelled entities at the micro or nanoscale is commonly referred to as active matter. These entities possess the ability to convert stored or ambient energy into directed motion, enabling them to actively navigate their environment and exhibit intriguing emergent phenomena.

## Bose-Einstein-like condensation transition for scalar active matter

One such a phenomenon is the emergence of a Bose-Einstein like condensation transition for scalar active matter, where multiple particles can occupy the same energy level. Due to the presence of a diffusivity edge where the diffusion coefficient drops non-smoothly to zero, the particles in the condensate lose the ability to move and are effectively "frozen" is that state. My research investigates the steady-state properties of such systems under the influence of an external driving force, which can modify the condensation transition drastically, even allowing for the existence of a low-temperature 'evaporation' transition, making the condensation a reentrant phenomenon.

## Non-Gaussian anomalous dynamics in systems of interacting run-and-tumble particles

In contrast with regular Brownian motion, where a particle's position follows a Gaussian distribution, in complex environments like living cells and crowded fluids, non-Gaussian anomalous dynamics occur, deviating from Gaussian behavior.While most research focuses on equilibrium systems, understanding the motion of particles in non-equilibrium systems is challenging due to the lack of a complete theory of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Recent progress has been made in studying simple non-equilibrium systems, including low-dimensional exclusion processes and active matter. 

In this context, my research investigates the motion of a tagged particle in different models: a bead-spring polymer model and a lattice model of run-and-tumble particles. The results reveal various regimes of motion, including ballistic, superdiffusive, subdiffusive, and diffusive behavior. The lattice model exhibits atypical, non-Gaussian dynamics due to a dynamically changing environment for the tagged particle. For this model, the position PDF can be approximately described by a Laplacian distribution, a particular choice that is also found in experiments on, e.g., the displacement of RNA-protein particles in <i>E. Coli</i>.  The basic physical idea is that the diffusivity $D$ of a particle diffusing in a complex medium evolves in time due to the heterogeneities of the environment. This is described by a time dependent diffusivity $D(t)$ that also evolves stochastically, by means of a superstatistical approach.
