The study of collective behavior and dynamics of systems composed of self-propelled entities at the micro or nanoscale is commonly referred to as active matter. These entities possess the ability to convert stored or ambient energy into directed motion, enabling them to actively navigate their environment and exhibit intriguing emergent phenomena.

## Bose-Einstein-like condensation transition for scalar active matter

One such a phenomenon is the emergence of a Bose-Einstein like condensation transition for scalar active matter, where multiple particles can occupy the same energy level. Due to the presence of a diffusivity edge where the diffusion coefficient drops non-smoothly to zero, the particles in the condensate lose the ability to move and are effectively "frozen" is that state. My research investigates the steady-state properties of such systems under the influence of an external driving force, which can modify the condensation transition drastically, even allowing for the existence of a low-temperature 'evaporation' transition, making the condensation a reentrant phenomenon.
