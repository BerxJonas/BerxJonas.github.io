I am a theoretical physicist specializing in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and applied mathematics. Currently, I am working as an MSCA postdoctoral fellow at the Niels Bohr International Academy in Copenhagen, Denmark. My primary focus lies in exploring the fascinating realm of stochastic thermodynamics within the context of biochemical replication.

My research interests are diverse and span across multiple domains. While I mainly find myself working on non-equilibrium physics, I find immense fascination in the application of complex networks, knot theory, and braiding principles to theoretical biophysics. By merging these disciplines, I strive to unravel the underlying mechanisms governing biological phenomena and push the boundaries of scientific knowledge.

I completed my PhD in theoretical physics at the KU Leuven in Belgium, where my research focused on the BLUES function method that is used to iteratively solve nonlinear differential equations, and on hierarchical deposition models.
