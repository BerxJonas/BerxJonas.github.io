Stochastic thermodynamics provides a framework for understanding and quantifying the thermodynamic behaviour of small-scale systems that deviate from equilibrium, taking into account the effects of fluctuations and noise. In contrast with equilibrium thermodynamics,  work and heat are treated as random variables in stochastic thermodynamics, where they can be determined on the level of single trajectories.

My research focuses on the stochastic behaviour of chemical reaction networks involved in (biochemical) replication processes. The most well-known of these is kinetic proofreading (KPR), where energy can be consumed, e.g., in the form of ATP hydrolysis, in order to increase accuracy on a microscopic scale. More specifically, I look at a form of proofreading called "energy relay proofreading", which is able to increase the accuracy without consuming ATP molecules by making use of the energy released through catalysis to elevate the enzyme to a higher energy state, from which it can then irreversibly proofread.
